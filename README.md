#1. ComputacionCientificaUNAB

It is a project grade by five members that implement numerical methods e.g: nonlinear function, numerical approaches, among others, for simulating math function that used on the engineering. Some these algorithms can be found here and visuality his functions on our web page [ccientifica](https://cursos.ing.unab.cl/).

In this repository you can found source code C++ for the following numerical method:

1. Root-finding algorithm
  * Bisection
  * Brent
  * False Position
  * Secant

2. Curve fitting (Numerical analysis & Regression analysis)
  * Lagrange (Polynomial interpolation)
  * Newton (Polynomial interpolation)
  * Spline
  * Linear regression
  * Quadratic minimum discrete

3. Differential equation
  * Euler

#2. Installation

## Condition
Run on omnly Unix/Linux, no ms-DOS.

## Requirement
If you want run only our numerical method code, need get standart C++ libraries
